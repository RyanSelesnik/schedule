## Subject Rotation Guide

With 4 courses and 7 days, here's a balanced rotation:

| Day | Primary Focus | Secondary (if time) |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|
| Monday | Predictive Control | - |
| Tuesday | Distributed Optimisation | - |
| Wednesday | Computer Vision & PR | - |
| Thursday | Distributed Optim. + Pred. Control | (lecture days) |
| Friday | Applied Adv. Optimisation | CV/PR (lecture day) |
| Saturday | **Deadline-driven** | Whatever is due soonest |
| Sunday | **Review / catch-up** | Flexible |

---

## Pre-Deadline Intensives

When deadlines approach, adjust the schedule:

**1 week before deadline:**
- Dedicate 2 weekend sessions to that course
- Steal 1 hour from other subjects on weekdays

**2-3 days before deadline:**
- Focus exclusively on deadline work
- Use all available study time

---

## Lab Session Recommendation

**Recommended: Friday 09:00-11:00**

Reasons:
- Monday morning is valuable uninterrupted study time
- Friday you're already on campus for later classes
- Watch Applied Adv. Optimisation videos Thursday evening instead

However, if you prefer mornings for focused coding:
- **Choose Monday** if you're sharper in the morning for MATLAB work
